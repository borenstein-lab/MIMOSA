# MIMOSA
Model-based Integration of Metabolite Observations and Species Abundances

A pipeline for joint metabolic model-based analysis of metabolomics measurements and taxonomic composition from microbial communities. Includes an R package that implements the core integrative analysis functions as well as example pre-processing and analysis scripts. MIMOSA is under active development. See http://elbo.gs.washington.edu/download.html for a previous version of the code, used to produce the results in (Noecker et al, 2016).

## Contents

- **mimosa**: R package to generate community-specific metabolic network model, use the model to make metabolite predictions and identify consistent and contrasting metabolite variation, identify potential taxonomic contributors to metabolite variation, and shuffle the community metabolic network for comparison of results with a null model.

You can install **mimosa** using the `devtools` package in R:
```R
devtools::install_github("borenstein-lab/MIMOSA/mimosa")
```

- **runMimosa.R**: wrapper script, used to run main analysis from the command line

- **run_all.sh**: example script to regenerate results from the 4 datasets described in Noecker et al, 2016.

- **network_generation.R**: initial generation of metabolic network template from KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000)
